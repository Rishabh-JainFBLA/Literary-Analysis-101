<h1 id="el1" style="font: size 0.17em;"> Elements of Body 1</h1>
<h4 style="font: size 0.17em;">In a body paragraph, we have to organize it along the elements of SAY, MEAN, MATTER. This is to cite and explain evidence from the stories to help answer our prompt. Firstly, the say is the textual evidence that you will be giving. Secondly, the mean explains the text evidence and gives an overview of what it is stating. Lastly, the matter is when we tell the reader why that particular piece of evidence is important to the prompt. The first body paragraph will be talking about the compare part of the prompt. Remember to indent each new paragraph.</h4>
<ul style="font: size 0.17em;">

<h1 style="font: size 0.17em;" id="top-c"> Topic Sentence</h1>
<div><h4 style="font: size 0.17em;"> The topic sentence of the body paragrpah should relate to the thesis of the essay along with the basic <br>idea of what the body paragraph will be about. </h4>
<img id="fliping"style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"  src="fliping.gif">
Ex. Harry and Charlie both do immense things just because they are a little bit scared. 
<br><br> <h1 style="font: size 0.17em;" id="text1-c">Story 1 SAY </h1> 
<h4 style="font: size 0.17em;"> They Story 1 SAY is to cite textual evidence from the 1st story in order to show proof on how the 1st story connects to the prompt. Remember to cite the evidence in quotation marks(" ") and put any dialouge in the evidence in single quotes(''). Also, if you need to write in MLA Format(like I use), make sure to state the author's last name in ( ) after stating the piece of evidence. In addition, be sure to use textual evidence strategies like elipsses(...), which is when you cut parts out of a piece of evidence, to enhance your writing.</h4>
Ex. “His face was cold. 'What's wrong?' asked his wife. 'Let's get back on the rocket.' 'Go back to Earth?' 'Yes! Listen!'…'What can we do?'  'Build a rocket, that's what!” “A rocket, Harry?...Oh, Harry!' 'But you must want to go back. Have you noticed the peach blossoms, the onions, the grass?’” (Bradbury)
<br> <br><h1  style="font: size 0.17em;"id="stry1-mn-c"> Story 1 MEAN</h1>
<h4 style="font: size 0.17em;"> The Story 1 MEAN is to explain the textual evidence that was cited for Story 1. This is to make sure readers understand what the textual evidence actually means. It is what the text says but in your own words. </h4>
Ex. This means that as soon as Harry reached Mars, he knew that something was wrong and wanted to go back to Earth. He fears what will happen if he stays as everything is changing and is willing to go as far as to<br> build a rocket just to get out of Mars.   
<img id="typing" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"src="typing-unscreen.gif">
<br><br> <h1 style="font: size 0.17em;" id="stry1mt-c"> Story 1 MATTER</h1>
<h4 style="font: size 0.17em;"> The Story 1 MATTER is to make sure the reader knows why the textual evidence is important and how it connects back to the prompt. It is also to tell the reader why you chose that specific peice of evidence. These will be the longest sections of the paragraphs. </h4>
Ex. Everything around Harry is now slowly changing and Harry is scared about what might happen in the near future. This fear that he has is causing him to build a rocket from scratch. This matters because he is the only one who has the fear of Mars and the only person who has come to his senses. I picked this certain piece because it shows Harry's first impression of Mars and how he immediately wants to go back.This is important because Harry is actually thinking about building a rocket straight from scratch with no materials at his use.
<br> <br> <h1  style="font: size 0.17em;"id="stry2-sy-c"> Story 2 SAY</h1>
<h4 style="font: size 0.17em;"> Similar to the first SAY, this is to cite text evidence, but from the 2nd story. </h4>
Ex. (Charlie swings around, raises the gun, and suddenly pulls the trigger. The sound of the shot<br> explodes in the stillness. The figure suddenly lets out a small cry, stumbles forward onto his knees) <br>
Steve: (slowly looks up). It's Pete Van Horn. Don: (in a hushed voice). Pete Van Horn! He was just<br> gonna go over to the next block to see if the power was on... You killed him, Charlie. You shot him<br> dead! (Serling)
<img id="typer" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"src="typer-unscreen.gif"><br>
<br> <h1  style="font: size 0.17em;"id="stry2-mn-c"> Story 2 MEAN</h1>

<h4 style="font: size 0.17em;"> This is the same as the mean for story 1 but is explaining the text evidence from story 2 instead.</h4>
Ex. This means that Charlie was so scared that he ended up killing a person just because he didn't want anything to happen to him. The person who died was someone who just went to check on the next door community's electricity, but fear caused Charlie to shoot the man. He got so scared that he picked up a shotgun and shot a person.
<br><br><h1 style="font: size 0.17em;" id="stry2-mt-c"> Story 2 MATTER</h1>
<h4 style="font: size 0.17em;"> This is like the matter for story 1 but is showing how the text evidence from story 2 is important.</h4>
Ex. All of Maple Street's power just went out and it is dark outside. This enforces fear into everyone on Maple Street as they don't know the sudden cause of the power outage. Fear causes Charlie to shoot a person and kill them. This matters because a little scare goes as far as making a person become a murderer. I picked this piece of text because it shows the extraordinary measure that Charlie goes to just because he is a little bit scared. This is important since fear is<br> the entire reason why an innocent person has just died. 
<br><br><h1  style="font: size 0.17em;"id="cnct-c"> Connection to Prompt</h1>
<img id="reader"style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" src="reader-unscreen.gif">
<h4 style="font: size 0.17em;"> This is one sentence that connects the two pieces of evidence back to the prompt. It shows how evidence proves the thesis and makes our paragraph correct. </h4>
Ex. These two pieces of evidence connect and prove the thesis since they show the similar reactions between the two characters after they both encounter a certain fear. 
<br><br><h1  style="font: size 0.17em;"id="conc-c"> Conclusion Sentence </h1>
<h4 style="font: size 0.17em;"> The conclusion sentence is the last sentence of the paragraph and is used to sum it all up. It is similar to the connection sentence but relates to the thesis as a whole instead of the pieces of evidence. </h4>
<h3 style="font: size 0.17em;"> Concluding Transition Phrases:</h3>
<ul style="font: size 0.17em;"> 
    <li style="font: size 0.17em;"> All In All</li>
    <li style="font: size 0.17em;"> In Conclusion</li>
    <li style="font: size 0.17em;"> To Sum It All Up</li>
    <li style="font: size 0.17em;"> To Wrap It All Up</li>
    <li style="font: size 0.17em;"> To Conclude</li>
    <li style="font: size 0.17em;"> In The End</li>
    <li style="font: size 0.17em;"> To Finish</li>
</ul>
Ex.  All in all, Harry's and Charlie's actions were completely altered because of the fear that was instilled into them. 
<br> <br> <h1  style="font: size 0.17em;"id="finish-c"> Combining It All Up</h1>
Ex. Harry and Charlie both do immense things just because they are a little bit scared. “His face was cold. 'What's wrong?' asked his wife. 'Let's get back on the rocket.' 'Go back to Earth?' 'Yes! Listen!'…'What can we do?'  'Build a rocket, that's what!” “A rocket, Harry?...Oh, Harry!' 'But you must want to go back. Have you noticed the peach blossoms, the onions, the grass?’” (Bradbury)
