Dorothy Thompson once said, “The most destructive element in the human mind is fear. Fear creates aggressiveness; aggressiveness engenders hostility; hostility engenders fear, a disastrous circle.” This quote shows how fear is created from humans and is so disastrous that it drives people to commit terrible actions. In the story, "Dark They Were and Golden Eyed," the main character, Harry, is stuck on Mars along with a couple hundred other people after they fled Earth because of a war. However, over time, things around him are slowly changing and their memories are slowly drifting away. Similarly, in the play /Monsters Are Due on Maple Street/, a small community suddenly loses power out of nowhere. However, random activities occur as cars are randomly starting and lights are oddly turning on. In the short stories, “Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed,” by Ray Bradbury and /The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street/, by Rod Serling, the characters show how fear caused them to commit tremendous wrongdoings. 
   <br> <br>Harry and Charlie both do immense things just because they are a little bit scared. “His face was cold. 'What's wrong?' asked his wife. 'Let's get back on the rocket.' 'Go back to Earth?' 'Yes! Listen!'…'What can we do?'  'Build a rocket, that's what!” “A rocket, Harry?...Oh, Harry!' 'But you must want to go back. Have you noticed the peach blossoms, the onions, the grass?’” (Bradbury) This means that as soon as Harry reached Mars, he knew that something was wrong and wanted to go back to Earth. He fears what will happen if he stays as everything is changing and is willing to go as far as to build a rocket just to get out of Mars.
Everything around Harry is now slowly changing and Harry is scared about what might happen in the near future. This fear that he has is causing him to build a rocket from scratch. This matters because he is the only one who has the fear of Mars and the only person who has come to his senses. I picked this certain piece because it shows Harry's first impression of Mars and how he immediately wants to go back.This is important because Harry is actually thinking about building a rocket straight from scratch with no materials at his use.
(Charlie swings around, raises the gun, and suddenly pulls the trigger. The sound of the shot explodes in the stillness. The figure suddenly lets out a small cry, stumbles forward onto his knees) 
Steve: (slowly looks up). It's Pete Van Horn. Don: (in a hushed voice). Pete Van Horn! He was just gonna go over to the next block to see if the power was on... You killed him, Charlie. You shot him dead!(Serling)
This means that Charlie was so scared that he ended up killing a person just because he didn't want anything to happen to him. The person who died was someone who just went to check on the next door community's electricity, but fear caused Charlie to shoot the man. He got so scared that he picked up a shotgun and shot a person.
All of Maple Street's power just went out and it is dark outside. This enforces fear into everyone on Maple Street as they don't know the sudden cause of the power outage. Fear causes Charlie to shoot a person and kill them. This matters because a little scare goes as far as making a person become a murderer. I picked this piece of text because it shows the extraordinary measure that Charlie goes to just because he is a little bit scared. This is important since fear is the entire reason why an innocent person has just died. 
These two pieces of evidence connect and prove the thesis since they show the similar reactions between the two characters after they both encounter a certain fear. 
All in all, Harry's and Charlie's actions were completely altered because of the fear that was instilled into them.

To sum it all up, fear drives the characters into doing immense things such as killing a person and building an entire rocket. In the stories, “Dark They Were and Golden Eyed” and /The Monsters
    are Due on Maple Street/, the authors show the measures that the characters are willing to go to just because they have a little bit of fear instilled into them. Is there anything that you have been scared of? How did you  react when you saw it? Did you back down and let it scare you, or stand up and confront it?
