        <h3 style="font: size 0.17em;"> First, before we do anything with the introduction paragraph, we need to <br>write our title. Our title should be something that stands out, hooks the <br>reader in, and relates to what the essay will be about. </h3>

        <h4 style="font: size 0.17em;"> The introduction is the first part of the essay other than the title. <br>The introduction paragraph is not only to hook the reader in, making<br> them want to read more, but to give a brief summary of the stories<br> along with answer the prompt that was given. </h4>

        <h4 style="font: size 0.17em;"> The background information is the usually the second part of the introduction paragraph. It <br>consists of the basic summary of the stories such as the main character and a little bit of <br>information about them. This lets the reader know more about the stories before they read<br> the analysis so that they understand the basis of the rest of the essay. Remember to cite<br> the stories correctly when you state them. Short stories should be in quotes(" ") and plays<br> should be italicized(/). </h4>
     
        Ex. In the story, "Dark They Were and Golden Eyed," the main character, Harry, is stuck on Mars<br> along with a couple hundred other people after they fled Earth because of a war.

However, random activities occur as cars are randomly starting and lights are oddly <br>turning on.

        <h1 style="font: size 0.17em;" id="finish-intro"> Putting It All Together (I Used Quotation Hook)</h3>
        <br> Ex. Dorothy Thompson once said, “The most destructive element in the human mind is fear. Fear creates aggressiveness; aggressiveness engenders hostility; hostility engenders fear, a disastrous circle.” This quote shows how fear is created from humans and is so disastrous that it drives people to commit terrible actions. In the story, "Dark They Were and Golden Eyed," the main character, Harry, is stuck on Mars along with a couple hundred other people after they fled Earth because of a war. However, over time, things around him are slowly changing and their memories are slowly drifting away. Similarly, in the play /Monsters Are Due on Maple Street,/ a small community suddenly loses power out of nowhere. However, random activities occur as cars are randomly starting and lights are oddly turning on. In the short stories, “Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed,” by Ray Bradbury and /The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street/, by Rod Serling, the characters show how fear caused them to commit tremendous wrongdoings.
